## Usage Guidelines

### Best Practices
1. Enable all enhancement components for complex tasks
2. Adjust beam width and memory size based on task complexity
3. Use temperature control for creative vs precise outputs
4. Balance cache size with available resources

### Resource Management
1. Monitor GPU memory usage
2. Use gradient checkpointing for large batches
3. Enable component pruning for efficiency
4. Optimize cache update frequency

## Ethical Considerations

### Data Privacy
- No personal information in training data
- Memory contents are cleared between sessions
- Cache entries are anonymized

### Model Bias
- Balanced training datasets
- Regular bias audits
- Documented limitations
- Transparent architecture
