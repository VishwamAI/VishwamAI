## Features

### 1. Neural Memory Module
- Persistent memory for long-term information retention
- Multi-head attention for memory access
- Structured reasoning patterns
- Dynamic memory updates

### 2. Tree of Thoughts
- Tree-structured reasoning for complex problems
- Beam search with pruning
- State refinement and evaluation
- Dynamic path selection

### 3. Differentiable Cache
- Efficient information retrieval
- Learnable cache updates
- Access pattern optimization
- Memory-efficient storage

## Installation

```bash
# From PyPI
pip install vishwamai

# From source
git clone https://github.com/VishwamAI/VishwamAI.git
cd VishwamAI
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

```python
from vishwamai import EnhancedVishwamAI

# Initialize model with all components
model = EnhancedVishwamAI(
    model_path="kasinadhsarma/vishwamai-model",
    use_memory=True,
    use_tree=True,
    use_cache=True
)

# Generate response
response = model.generate_response(
    "Explain quantum entanglement and provide a mathematical proof.",
    max_length=512,
    temperature=0.7
)

print(response)
```

## Training

Refer to our [Training Guide](TRAINING.md) for detailed instructions on training and fine-tuning.

```python
from vishwamai.trainer import VishwamAIPretrainer
from vishwamai.neural_memory import ReasoningMemoryTransformer
from vishwamai.tree_of_thoughts import TreeOfThoughts
from vishwamai.cache_augmentation import DifferentiableCacheAugmentation

# Initialize components
model = load_model(config_path)
memory = ReasoningMemoryTransformer()
tree = TreeOfThoughts(model)
cache = DifferentiableCacheAugmentation()

# Configure trainer
trainer = VishwamAIPretrainer(
    model=model,
    memory_module=memory,
    tree_module=tree,
    cache_module=cache
)

# Start training
trainer.train()
```
