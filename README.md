# VishwamAI: Enhanced Transformer with Advanced Reasoning Capabilities

VishwamAI is a state-of-the-art language model that incorporates several advanced mechanisms for improved reasoning, memory retention, and computational efficiency.

## Model Description

VishwamAI extends the transformer architecture with three key innovations:

1. **Differentiable Cache Augmentation**
   - Enriches the transformer's key-value cache with learnable latent embeddings
   - Enables asynchronous reasoning and better memory utilization
   - Uses gated connections for selective updating

2. **Neural Long-Term Memory**
   - Explicit memory layers with read/write/forget gates
   - Multi-head memory attention for improved information retrieval
   - Hierarchical memory architecture for better information organization

3. **Tree of Thoughts Reasoning**
   - Explores multiple reasoning paths simultaneously
   - Uses beam search to maintain promising solution paths
   - Scores intermediate steps for better decision making

## Model Architecture

- Base Architecture: Transformer with Mixture of Experts
- Context Length: 32,768 tokens
- Hidden Size: 8,192
- Number of Attention Heads: 64
- Number of Layers: 120
- Vocabulary Size: 64,000
- Parameter Count: 671B

## Training

The model is trained on a diverse set of datasets:
