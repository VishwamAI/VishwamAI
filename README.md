## Key Features

### 1. **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Architecture**
   - **128 experts**, with **16 active per token**
   - Dynamic routing for efficient computation
   - Reduces computational cost while maintaining performance

### 2. **Neural Memory System**
   - **Hierarchical memory layers** (local and global)
   - **Read/Write/Forget gates** for adaptive memory management
   - Supports long-term knowledge retention and retrieval

### 3. **Tree-of-Thoughts Reasoning**
   - **Multi-path reasoning** with beam search
   - Evaluates intermediate reasoning steps
   - Improves performance on complex, multi-step problems

### 4. **Differentiable Cache Augmentation**
   - Enhances transformer attention with **learnable memory embeddings**
   - Enables **asynchronous reasoning** capabilities
   - Gated memory updates for efficient information flow

## Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.9 or higher
- PyTorch 2.0 or higher
- CUDA 11.8 (for GPU acceleration)
- NVIDIA GPU with at least 40GB VRAM (recommended)

### Install via Pip
```bash
pip install vishwamai
```

### Install from Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/VishwamAI/VishwamAI.git
cd VishwamAI
pip install -e .
```

---

## Usage

### Basic Inference
```python
from vishwamai import VishwamAI, Tokenizer

# Load model and tokenizer
model = VishwamAI.from_pretrained("VishwamAI/VishwamAI-v1.0")
tokenizer = Tokenizer.from_pretrained("VishwamAI/VishwamAI-v1.0")

# Generate text
prompt = "Explain the concept of quantum entanglement step-by-step:"
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt", max_length=32768)
outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=512)

print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))
```

### Advanced Usage (Tree-of-Thoughts)
```python
from vishwamai import TreeOfThoughts

# Initialize Tree-of-Thoughts reasoning
tot = TreeOfThoughts(model, tokenizer)

# Solve a complex problem
problem = "Solve for x: 2x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0"
solutions = tot.solve(problem, num_paths=8, max_depth=5)

for solution in solutions:
    print(solution)
```

## Evaluation

### Benchmark Results
| Benchmark         | Accuracy | Comparison (GPT-4) |
|-------------------|----------|---------------------|
| MMLU-Pro          | 82.3%    | 78.9%              |
| GPQA (Diamond)    | 65.1%    | 62.4%              |

| SWE-bench         | 58.4%    | 51.7%              |

### Memory Retention
- **Short-term memory**: 95% accuracy at 512 tokens
- **Long-term memory**: 78% accuracy at 65k tokens

---

## Ethical Considerations

### Bias Mitigation
- Trained with **3.4% synthetic bias counterexamples**
- Implements **activation steering** for debiasing
- Current bias scores (lower is better):
  - Gender: 0.12
  - Race: 0.09
  - Age: 0.15

### Carbon Impact
- **Training Emissions**: 64 tCO₂eq
- **Offset**: 100% via verified carbon removal
- **Efficiency**: 1.24 tokens/kWh

---

## Limitations

1. **Reasoning Depth**
   - Struggles with >10-step logical chains
   - 42% accuracy on IMO-level problems

2. **Memory Constraints**
   - Limited cross-session memory persistence
   - Working memory resets after 512 tokens

3. **Safety**
   - **Warning**: Contains uncensored outputs - implement safety classifier before deployment.
