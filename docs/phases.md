**VishwamAI Development Phases**

---

### **📌 Phase 1: Data Collection & Preprocessing**
🔹 **Goal:** Gather high-quality datasets for pretraining.
🔹 **Tasks:**  
✅ Collect data using **distillation from Perplexity-AI/r1-1776, Tencent-Hunyuan-Large**.  
✅ Preprocess text using **tokenization (SentencePiece, BPE, Unigram)**.  
✅ Save in **`.safetensors` format** for efficient storage.  
✅ Store datasets in **Hugging Face LFS**.  

---

### **📌 Phase 2: Initial Pretraining (Standard LLM Training)**
🔹 **Goal:** Train VishwamAI with foundational knowledge.
🔹 **Tasks:**  
✅ Use **Distillation (from LLaMA 3, GPT-4, Mistral, etc.)**.  
✅ Train on **Google Colab TPUs** with **JAX, Flax** (LoRA + Quantization).  
✅ Save model checkpoints & track loss/performance.  

---

### **📌 Phase 3: Fine-Tuning for Reasoning & Memory**
🔹 **Goal:** Improve reasoning, coding, math, and knowledge recall.
🔹 **Tasks:**  
✅ Fine-tune with **domain-specific datasets** (coding, medicine, legal).  
✅ Integrate **long-context optimization (ALiBi, RoPE, Memory Attention)**.  
✅ Implement **multi-turn conversation training** for better context handling.  

---

### **📌 Phase 4: Tree of Thoughts (ToT) Training**
🔹 **Goal:** Enhance problem-solving & multi-step reasoning.
🔹 **Tasks:**  
✅ Apply **ToT techniques (BFS, DFS, structured problem-solving)**.  
✅ Train on **GSM8K (math), BBH (complex tasks), MATH dataset**.  
✅ Use **RLHF (Reward-Slap training)** to refine response quality.  

---

### **📌 Phase 5: Large-Scale Deployment & API Integration**
🔹 **Goal:** Make VishwamAI accessible via API or chatbot.
🔹 **Tasks:**  
✅ Deploy **low-latency inference (TPU-based serving, quantization)**.  
✅ Implement **Next.js frontend & FastAPI backend** for user access.  
✅ Develop **GitHub-based AI agent for bug prediction, automation**.  

---

### **📌 Phase 6: Expansion & Research Optimization**
🔹 **Goal:** Scale VishwamAI beyond chat, explore multimodal capabilities.
🔹 **Tasks:**  
✅ Train for **image, video, audio understanding (multimodal AI)**.  
✅ Explore **Self-Refinement, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Auto-Evolution**.  
✅ Prepare for **commercialization, funding, and AI research center setup**.
