## Model Architecture

### Overview
Vishwamai combines Mixture of Experts (MoE) with Multi-Level Attention (MLA) in a transformer-based architecture. This design enables both efficient processing of long sequences and adaptive computation based on input complexity.

### Key Components

#### 1. Mixture of Experts (MoE)
- **Router Design**: Two-stage top-k routing system
  ```python
  scores = router(input_tokens)  # [batch_size, seq_len, num_experts]
  top_k_scores, indices = select_top_k(scores, k=2)
  ```

- **Expert Architecture**:
  - Feed-forward networks with configurable hidden dimensions
  - Shared input/output projections
  - Individual layer normalization and dropout

- **Load Balancing**:
  ```python
  # Auxiliary loss for load balancing
  aux_loss = compute_load_balance_loss(
      scores,      # Router scores
      dispatch,    # Expert assignments
      num_experts  # Total experts
  )
  ```

#### 2. Multi-Level Attention (MLA)

- **Hierarchical Processing**:
  ```plaintext
  Level 0 (Fine): Full sequence length, high resolution
  Level 1 (Medium): 1/2 sequence length, medium resolution
  Level 2 (Coarse): 1/4 sequence length, low resolution
  ```

- **Level Fusion**:
  ```python
  # Adaptive fusion of attention levels
  fused_output = sum(
      level_weights[i] * upsample(level_outputs[i])
      for i in range(num_levels)
  )
  ```

- **Sparse Computation**:
  - Efficient attention patterns at each level
  - Progressive sparsification at higher levels
  - Optimized memory usage through level-wise processing

## Implementation Details

### Memory Optimization

1. **Gradient Checkpointing**:
```python
def checkpointed_forward(self, x):
    def custom_forward(*inputs):
        return self.block_forward(*inputs)
    return checkpoint.checkpoint(custom_forward, x)
```

2. **Expert Sharding**:
```python
# Distribute experts across TPU devices
expert_parallel_config = {
    'strategy': 'uniform',
    'num_experts_per_device': num_experts // num_devices
}
```

3. **Attention Optimization**:
```python
# Flash Attention implementation
attention_output = flash_attention(
    query=q,
    key=k,
    value=v,
    dropout_p=self.dropout,
    causal=True
)
```

### TPU Optimization

1. **XLA Compilation**:
```python
@torch.jit.script
def optimized_forward(self, x):
    # TPU-optimized forward pass
    return self.efficient_computation(x)
```

2. **Data Pipeline**:
```python
def create_tpu_dataloader(dataset, batch_size):
    sampler = DistributedSampler(
        dataset,
        num_replicas=xm.xrt_world_size(),
        rank=xm.get_ordinal()
    )
    return DataLoader(
        dataset,
        batch_size=batch_size,
        sampler=sampler,
        num_workers=8
    )
```

### Training Methodology

1. **Mixed Precision Training**:
```python
scaler = torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler()
with torch.cuda.amp.autocast():
    loss = model(input_ids, labels=labels)
scaler.scale(loss).backward()
```

2. **Expert Load Balancing**:
```python
def compute_load_balance_loss(router_probs, assignments):
    expert_counts = assignments.sum(dim=(0, 1))
    target_count = assignments.sum() / num_experts
    return torch.abs(expert_counts - target_count).mean()
```

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Usage

- Expert Parameters: `num_experts * expert_size * 4 bytes`
- Attention Memory: `batch_size * seq_len * hidden_size * 4 bytes`
- Router Memory: `batch_size * seq_len * num_experts * 4 bytes`

### Computational Complexity

1. **Attention Complexity**:
```plaintext
Level 0: O(N^2 * d)
Level 1: O((N/2)^2 * d)
Level 2: O((N/4)^2 * d)
Total: ~O(5/8 * N^2 * d)  # Reduced from O(N^2 * d)
```

2. **Router Complexity**:
```plaintext
Forward: O(batch_size * seq_len * num_experts)
Expert Computation: O(batch_size * seq_len * expert_size / num_experts)
```

### Optimization Guidelines

1. **TPU-Specific**:
   - Use powers of 2 for dimensions
   - Align memory accesses
   - Minimize host-device transfers

2. **Expert Configuration**:
   - Balance expert capacity and number
   - Monitor load distribution
   - Adjust routing temperature

3. **Memory Management**:
   - Use gradient checkpointing
   - Implement smart caching
   - Optimize attention patterns

## Benchmarking

### Memory Profiling
```python
def profile_memory():
    torch.cuda.reset_peak_memory_stats()
    model(input_ids)
    peak_memory = torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated()
    return peak_memory
```

### Speed Benchmarks
```python
def benchmark_forward_pass(model, input_batch, num_runs=100):
    timings = []
    for _ in range(num_runs):
        start_time = time.time()
        with torch.no_grad():
            model(input_batch)
        timings.append(time.time() - start_time)
    return np.mean(timings), np.std(timings)
```

## Internal Mistakes

### Common Internal Mistakes

1. **Incorrect Variable Naming**
   - **Cause**: Typographical errors during variable assignment
   - **Solution**: Use consistent naming conventions and code reviews
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     # Mistake: Incorrect variable name caused a runtime error
     # Corrective Action: Renamed the variable to match the expected name
     correct_variable_name = incorrect_variable_name
     ```

2. **Deprecated Function Usage**
   - **Cause**: Lack of awareness about deprecation
   - **Solution**: Regularly update dependencies and review deprecation warnings
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     # Mistake: Used a deprecated function that caused compatibility issues
     # Corrective Action: Replaced the deprecated function with the recommended alternative
     new_function = recommended_function()
     ```

3. **Hardcoded Values**
   - **Cause**: Quick fixes or lack of configuration management
   - **Solution**: Use configuration files or environment variables
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     # Mistake: Hardcoded value for batch size
     # Corrective Action: Moved batch size to configuration file
     batch_size = config['batch_size']
     ```

### Guidelines for Documenting Internal Mistakes

   - Document the steps taken to prevent future occurrences

3. **Use Clear and Concise Language**

   - Implement comprehensive testing to identify issues before deployment
   - Use unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests

3. **Continuous Learning**
   - Encourage team members to stay updated with the latest best practices
