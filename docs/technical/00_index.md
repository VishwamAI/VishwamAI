## Usage Example

```python
from vishwamai import VishwamAI, VishwamAITokenizer

# Load model
model = VishwamAI.from_pretrained("vishwamai/base")
tokenizer = VishwamAITokenizer.from_pretrained("vishwamai/base")

# Generate text
text = "Explain the concept of machine learning:"
input_ids = tokenizer.encode(text, return_tensors="jax")
outputs = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=512)
response = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
```
