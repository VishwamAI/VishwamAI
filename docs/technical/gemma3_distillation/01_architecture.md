## Knowledge Distillation Framework

### Teacher-Student Architecture

The knowledge distillation framework utilizes a larger Gemma 3 model (e.g., 27B parameters) as the teacher and transfers knowledge to a smaller model (e.g., 4B parameters) through multiple mechanisms:

1. **Linear Path Embeddings**
   - Efficient knowledge transfer through optimized linear projections
   - TPU-optimized layer normalization
   - Dropout regularization during training

2. **Intermediate Layer Distillation**
   - Feature-level knowledge transfer
   - Cosine similarity loss for representation alignment
   - Progressive layer mapping strategies

3. **Attention Map Transfer**
   - Direct transfer of attention patterns
   - Temperature-scaled softmax distributions
   - Masked attention handling

## Memory Optimization

### Zero-3 Style Optimizations

1. **Parameter Sharding**
   - Optimizer state partitioning
   - Gradient accumulation
   - Dynamic memory management

2. **Quantization Strategy**
   ```python
   class QuantizationConfig:
       int4_weights: bool = True
       fp8_activation: bool = True
       block_size: int = 128
       optimize_memory: bool = True
   ```

### TPU-Specific Optimizations

1. **Memory Layout**
   - Optimal tensor shapes for TPU
   - Efficient data loading patterns
   - Hardware-aware batch processing

2. **Computation Patterns**
   - JIT compilation strategies
   - XLA optimization techniques
   - Custom TPU kernels

## Training Pipeline

```

### Training Configuration

```python
class DistillationConfig:
    teacher_model: str = "gemma-3-27b"
    student_model: str = "gemma-3-4b"
    temperature: float = 2.0
    alpha: float = 0.5
    batch_size: int = 32
    gradient_accumulation_steps: int = 4
    use_flash_attention: bool = True
    use_quantization: bool = True
```
