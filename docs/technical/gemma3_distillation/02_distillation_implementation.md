```

## Training Pipeline Implementation

        # Forward pass through teacher
        # Generate soft targets
        # Train student model
        # Update parameters
```

### 2. Loss Functions

```python

        temperature: float = 2.0
    ):
        # Compute distillation loss
        # Balance multiple loss terms
        # Return weighted sum
