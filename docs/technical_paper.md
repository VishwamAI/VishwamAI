### 2.2 Key Innovations

#### 2.2.1 Reinforcement Learning-based Autoscaling
The system employs a PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) agent to dynamically adjust:
- Batch sizes
- Cache allocation
- Resource utilization

```python
def _action_to_config(self, action: np.ndarray) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    return {
        "batch_size": max(1, min(32, int(action[0] * 32))),
        "cache_size": int(action[1] * 8192)
    }
```

#### 2.2.2 Neural Memory Augmentation
Three-tier memory system:
1. Differentiable cache for frequent patterns
2. Neural memory transformer for context retention
3. Tree of thoughts for complex reasoning

#### 2.2.3 Hardware Optimization
Leverages TVM for platform-specific optimizations:
```python
with tvm.transform.PassContext(opt_level=3):
    lib = relay.build(mod, target=self.tvm_target, params=params)
```

## 3. Implementation Details
