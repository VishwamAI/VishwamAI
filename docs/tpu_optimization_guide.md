# TPU v2 Optimization Guide for VishwamAI in Google Colab

This guide provides comprehensive strategies for maximizing training efficiency with VishwamAI on TPU v2 setups in Google Colab, addressing the unique architecture and memory constraints of these accelerators.

## 1. Introduction to TPU v2 in Google Colab

### TPU v2 Architecture Overview

TPU v2 in Google Colab offers 8 cores (v2-8 configuration) with:
- 4 TPU chips with 2 cores per chip
- 8GB of High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) per core (64GB total)
- ~300GB of higher-latency host system memory
- 128x128 Matrix Multiply Units (MXUs) optimized for tensor operations
- High-speed interconnect between cores for efficient communication

### Advantages for VishwamAI Training

TPUs offer significant advantages for VishwamAI transformer models:
- Highly optimized for matrix multiplications common in transformers
- Systolic array architecture for efficient tensor processing
- Native support for bfloat16 precision
- Efficient parallel computation across 8 cores

## 2. Quick Start with VishwamAI on TPU v2

Run the optimized training script with:
```bash
python optimize_train_tpu.py --config configs/tpu_optimized_config.yaml
```

For additional profiling information to further optimize your setup:
```bash
python optimize_train_tpu.py --config configs/tpu_optimized_config.yaml --profile
```

### TPU Initialization in VishwamAI

Your code should initialize TPUs with:

```python
import jax

# For VishwamAI with TensorFlow integration
try:
    tpu = tf.distribute.cluster_resolver.TPUClusterResolver()
    tf.config.experimental_connect_to_cluster(tpu)
    tf.tpu.experimental.initialize_tpu_system(tpu)
    strategy = tf.distribute.TPUStrategy(tpu)
except ValueError:
    print("TPU not detected")
    
# For pure JAX implementation (recommended for VishwamAI)
devices = jax.devices()
print(f"Available TPU cores: {len(devices)}")
```

## 3. Memory Optimization Techniques

The core challenge with TPU v2 in Colab is managing the 8GB HBM per core constraint. VishwamAI implements several memory-efficient techniques:

### 3.1 Gradient Accumulation

The script uses gradient accumulation to simulate larger batch sizes while keeping memory usage low:

```yaml
training:
  initial_batch_size: 8
  gradient_accumulation_steps: 4  # Effective batch size = 8 * 4 * 8_devices = 256
```

Implementation in `vishwamai/pipeline.py` allows for efficient multi-step updates:
- Accumulates gradients over multiple forward/backward passes
- Updates model parameters only after accumulating for specified steps
- Works seamlessly with VishwamAI's TPU-optimized computation

### 3.2 Mixed Precision Training with bfloat16

VishwamAI leverages bfloat16 precision which is optimal for TPU v2 and reduces memory by half:

```yaml
model:
  dtype: "bfloat16"  # TPU-optimized format
```

This precision format is particularly efficient because:
- Native hardware support in TPU v2 
- Better numerical stability than float16
- Same exponent range as float32 but reduced mantissa precision
- Implemented in `vishwamai/kernels` for optimal performance

### 3.3 Dynamic Batch Sizing

The training script automatically determines the optimal batch size:

```yaml
training:
  dynamic_batch_size: true
  batch_size_increase_step: 2000
  batch_size_increase_factor: 1.2
```

This allows VishwamAI to:
- Start with conservative batch sizes for stability
- Gradually increase batch size as training stabilizes
- Maximize TPU utilization without OOM errors

### 3.4 Memory-Efficient Model Architecture

VishwamAI implements TPU-specific optimizations:

- **Grouped Query Attention (GQA)**: Reduces KV cache memory usage
- **Gradient Checkpointing**: Trades computation for memory by not saving all activations
- **Activation Recomputation**: Recalculates activations during backward pass
- **Optimal Tensor Dimensions**: Aligns with TPU's preference for dimensions divisible by 8 or 128
- **Chunked Processing**: Processes sequences in smaller chunks to reduce peak memory

### 3.5 Data Pipeline Optimization

Efficient data loading is crucial for TPU performance:

```python
# From vishwamai/pipeline.py
dataset = dataset.interleave(
    read_tfrecord,
    cycle_length=tf.data.AUTOTUNE,
    num_parallel_calls=tf.data.AUTOTUNE
)
dataset = dataset.prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)
```

Key optimizations:
- Use of TFRecord format for efficient TPU data loading
- Prefetching to ensure TPUs are never idle waiting for data
- Parallel data preprocessing on CPU to avoid TPU bottlenecks
- Overlapping data transfer with computation

## 4. Distributed Training Across TPU v2 Cores

VishwamAI leverages all 8 TPU v2 cores through data parallelism strategies:

### 4.1 JAX pmap Implementation

```python
# Parallel computation across TPU cores
train_step_pmap = jax.pmap(train_step, axis_name='batch')
```

The library implements:
- Automatic sharding of batch data across devices
- Synchronized gradient updates via all-reduce operations
- Optimized TPU-to-TPU communication

### 4.2 Global Batch Size Considerations

With 8 TPU cores, effective batch size scales accordingly:

```
Global batch size = per_core_batch_size * grad_accum_steps * 8
```

Recommended settings in `configs/tpu_optimized_config.yaml`:
- Small model: 32 per device × 2 accum steps × 8 cores = 512 global batch
- Medium model: 16 per device × 3 accum steps × 8 cores = 384 global batch
- Large model: 8 per device × 4 accum steps × 8 cores = 256 global batch

## 5. Optimized Tree of Thoughts for TPU

The VishwamAI Tree of Thoughts (ToT) implementation has been specifically optimized for TPU v2 constraints:

```yaml
tot:
  max_thoughts: 5       # Reduce if memory limited
  thoughts_per_step: 3  # Controls memory used per step
  memory_efficient: true
  beam_width: 3         # Controls search breadth
  max_depth: 5          # Controls search depth
```

Optimizations include:
- Reduced memory footprint for thought generation
- Efficient parallel thought evaluation across TPU cores
- TPU-optimized search strategies with JAX-based computation
- Adaptive priority allocation to most promising reasoning paths
- Re-use of computed values to minimize redundant computation

## 6. Advanced XLA Optimizations

VishwamAI leverages JAX's XLA compiler for TPU optimization:

### 6.1 JIT Compilation

```python
@jax.jit
def training_step(state, batch, rng):
    # Training implementation
```

Benefits:
- Fuses operations to reduce memory transfers
- Optimizes tensor layouts for TPU v2 architecture
- Removes redundant computations

### 6.2 Tensor Shape Optimization

TPU v2 prefers tensor dimensions divisible by 8 or 128:

```yaml
model:
  hidden_size: 768      # Multiple of 128
  ffn_dim: 3072         # Multiple of 128
  num_attention_heads: 12  # Multiple of 4
```

This alignment prevents inefficient padding and maximizes MXU utilization.

## 7. Configuration Best Practices for TPU v2

Based on the 8GB per core constraint, recommendations for VishwamAI:

### 7.1 Scaling Model Size

- **hidden_size**: 768-1024 (depending on sequence length)
- **num_layers**: 18-24
- **num_attention_heads**: 12-16

### 7.2 Sequence Length Tradeoffs

- 2048 tokens: Use smaller hidden size (768)
- 1024 tokens: Can increase to hidden size 1024
- 512 tokens: Can add more layers (up to 32)

### 7.3 GQA Configuration

- For memory efficiency: `num_key_value_heads: 4`
- For accuracy with more memory: `num_key_value_heads: 8`

### 7.4 Gradient Accumulation Recommendations

- 2-4 steps for most workloads
- 8 steps for very large models
- Higher values help stability but slow training

## 8. Monitoring & Debugging

VishwamAI includes built-in memory tracking:

```
2023-05-15 14:20:32 - __main__ - INFO - Host memory usage: 15.42 GB
2023-05-15 14:20:32 - __main__ - INFO - TPU 0 peak memory: 6.78 GB
```

To optimize further, look for:
- High memory spikes during forward/backward passes
- Unbalanced memory usage across TPU devices
- Excessive host memory usage

### 8.1 JAX-specific Profiling

```python
from jax.experimental.compilation_cache import compilation_cache as cc
cc.initialize_cache("./jax_cache")  # Cache compilations to speed iterations

with jax.profiler.trace("./tpu_profile"):
    # Run training or inference
```

This generates profiles viewable in TensorBoard.

## 9. Sample Resource Profiles

| Configuration | TPU Memory per Device | Training Throughput | Recommended Batch Size |
|---------------|----------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Small (6L, 512h) | ~2.5 GB | ~1200 tokens/sec | 32 per device |  
| Medium (12L, 768h) | ~4.5 GB | ~700 tokens/sec | 16 per device |
| Large (24L, 1024h) | ~7.5 GB | ~300 tokens/sec | 8 per device |

## 10. Troubleshooting TPU v2 Issues

### OOM Errors

If encountering out-of-memory errors:
1. Reduce `initial_batch_size` (try halving it)
2. Increase `gradient_accumulation_steps` to maintain effective batch size
3. Reduce model size (`hidden_size`, `intermediate_size`, or `num_layers`)
4. Disable either `use_tot` or `use_error_correction` temporarily
5. Decrease sequence length if possible
6. Check for tensor dimension misalignment (ensure multiples of 8/128)
7. Verify that input sequences aren't padded excessively

### Slow Training

If training is slower than expected:
1. Check if TPUs are being fully utilized (should see >85% usage)
2. Ensure data loading isn't a bottleneck (increase `num_workers`)
3. Try decreasing `gradient_accumulation_steps`
4. Verify all TPU devices are being used with `jax.device_count()`
5. Look for unnecessary host-device transfers in your code
6. Check for synchronization points that cause TPU idle time
7. Ensure XLA is properly compiling your training function

### TPU Connection Issues in Colab

If TPU isn't connecting:
1. Verify TPU is selected in Colab runtime settings
2. Restart the runtime and reconnect
3. Check for compatible versions of JAX and TensorFlow
4. Ensure TPU initialization code runs early in notebook

## 11. Future Directions

As VishwamAI continues to evolve:

1. **Model Parallelism**: For models that exceed per-core memory, implementing tensor/pipeline parallelism
2. **Offloading Techniques**: Exploring CPU memory offloading for very large models
3. **Architecture Search**: Finding optimally efficient transformer configurations for TPU v2
4. **Adaptive Precision**: Dynamic precision management during different training phases
5. **Custom TPU Kernels**: Developing specialized operations for Tree of Thoughts reasoning
